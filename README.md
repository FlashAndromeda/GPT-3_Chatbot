# GPT-3_Chatbot
A simple chatbot I made using the GPT-3 API!

To use the bot, clone the repo and create a config.py file in your project directory and write this inside it:

API_KEY = 'your openai api key'


If you want to skip the fake loading screen, type in "gotta go fast" on the welcome screen and press Enter :)
